Problem: Calculate volume of 4-dimensional triangle

Using rspec and simple laws of geometry we can develop algorithms that will calculate correct results.
Further understanding of algorithm may lead us to analytical formula.

Same formula can be used in calculations of further dependent objects

Each class in Geometry module implement several approximations written as spec develops from simple to more complex.

Generalizations:
1. In calculations of a height in two dimensions we notice divisor of 2 and in three dimensions same one of 3. 
We project that next dimensions will have a corresponding number

2. In calculations of volume we progress through dimensions of space from
simple 0 and 1 to understandable and measurable 2 and 3 and leap forward to 4 and N.

This demonstrates how to test drive algorithms to correct calculations and extrapolate results.
