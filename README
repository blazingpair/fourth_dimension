Problem: Calculate volume of 4-dimentional triangle

Using rspec and simple laws of geomenry we can develop algorythms that will calculate correct results.
Further understanding of algorithm may lead us to analitical formula.

Same formula can be used in calculations of further dependent objects

Each class in Geometry module implement several approximations written as spec develops from simple to more complex.

Generalizations:
1. In calculations of a hight in two dimentions we notice divider of 2 and in three dimentions same one of 3. 
We project that next dimentions will have a corresponding number

2. In calculations of volume
